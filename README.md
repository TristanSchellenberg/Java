# Java-Practice
I uploaded all of these projects together from my Codio IDE to showcase my Java learning journey and enhance my resume.

1. Todo List App
This was one of my first Java projects, where I built a simple console-based To-Do List application. The user could add, remove, and view tasks on their list, acting like a super-basic version of a productivity app. It was straightforward, but it helped me get more comfortable with managing data and user input.

Difficulty: Easy. The main focus was on using ArrayList to manage tasks, and working with loops and the Scanner class to take user input.
Time Taken: Around 2-3 hours. Most of the time was spent implementing basic functionality and making sure I understood how to handle input and output effectively. It was a perfect introduction to the basics of Java.

2. Student Grade Calculator (Grade Management System)
Next, I created a student grade calculator to manage student records and compute the class average. The program takes in names and grades, calculates the average, and displays all the results. This was an extension of using arrays and loops but with a more structured approach to organizing data.

Difficulty: Easy to Medium. While the logic was simple, I needed to ensure that calculations worked correctly and that the program was flexible enough to handle different numbers of students. I also practiced breaking tasks into methods, which was a new and valuable exercise.
Time Taken: About 2-3 hours. Once I got the hang of handling arrays and methods, the rest of the project came together smoothly.

3. Bank Account Management System (Finance Management System)
This was where things started to get more complex. I built a system to manage bank accounts, where users could create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, and check balances. It required me to handle more advanced operations like dealing with insufficient funds and managing accounts securely.

Difficulty: Medium. I had to work with Maps to store account data, and I also had to think about edge cases like invalid account operations. The challenge was ensuring that user errors (like trying to withdraw more money than available) were handled properly.
Time Taken: About 4-5 hours. Debugging took longer than expected, particularly when trying to handle multiple accounts and ensuring data integrity with deposits and withdrawals.

4. Contact Management System
This project was all about building a console-based address book where users could add, view, search, and delete contacts. It was my first project using classes and objects more extensively, which meant thinking more about structuring my code for scalability.

Difficulty: Medium. Managing a list of Contact objects was a step up from simpler data structures, and writing the logic for searching and deleting contacts added another layer of complexity. I had to ensure the system handled edge cases, like searching for contacts that didnâ€™t exist.
Time Taken: Around 6-7 hours. Most of my time went into refining the search and delete functionality and debugging input handling issues.

5. Quiz Application
One of the most challenging projects I worked on was the Quiz Application. This project read multiple-choice questions from an external file, displayed them to the user, and calculated their score based on the correct answers. It involved working with file handling, user input, and error checking.

Difficulty: Medium. The hardest part was dealing with file handling for the first time, making sure the program could read and parse the file correctly. I also had to make sure user input was processed accurately and that the quiz flowed smoothly.
Time Taken: About 6-7 hours. Understanding how to work with files took a while, but once I grasped it, the rest of the project came together more easily.
